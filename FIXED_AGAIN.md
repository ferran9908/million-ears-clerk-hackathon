# ✅ Chat Error Fixed!

## 🐛 The Problem

When sending a message, you got this error:

```
Trying to execute chat.js:sendMessage as Mutation, but it is defined as Action.
```

## 🔧 The Fix

**Updated `components/chat-interface.tsx`:**

### Before (Wrong):

```typescript
import { useMutation } from "convex/react";

const sendMessage = useMutation(api.chat.sendMessage as any);
```

### After (Correct):

```typescript
import { useAction } from "convex/react";

const sendMessage = useAction(api.chat.sendMessage as any);
```

## 📝 Why This Happened

In Convex:

- **Mutations** = Database writes (fast, transactional)
- **Actions** = External API calls (like OpenAI) - can be slow

Since `sendMessage` calls OpenAI, it **must be an Action**, not a Mutation.

The frontend needs to use `useAction()` to call Actions, not `useMutation()`.

## ✅ What's Fixed

**File**: `components/chat-interface.tsx`

- ✅ Changed `useMutation` → `useAction`
- ✅ Now correctly calls the action
- ✅ Ready to send messages to OpenAI
